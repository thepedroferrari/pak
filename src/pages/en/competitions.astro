        Since <strong>1995</strong>, the Pak Shao Lin competition team has been a force in both
        traditional Kung Fu and modern Wushu tournaments. Our athletes compete at the state,
        national, and international level, representing Brazil in world championships and
        accumulating hundreds of medals across all categories.
      </p>
      <p>
        The team trains under the direct supervision of <strong>Master Gilmar Dantas</strong> and
        senior instructors, focusing on traditional forms (Taolu), sparring (Sanda), and weapons.
        New members are welcome to join the competition team after demonstrating commitment
        and reaching the required skill level.
